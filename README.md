# Simple Keylogger

🎯 Simple Keylogger (Prodigy Internship)
This project is created as part of the Prodigy Infotech program to demonstrate how a basic keylogger works using Python. The tool logs keyboard input and stores it in a file, helping learners understand how keylogging operates at a fundamental level.



💡 What It Does
The keylogger runs in the background and records every key pressed by the user. The logged data is stored in a text file and can be used to observe real-time keystroke behavior.



✨ Features
Captures all keypress events

Stores logs in a .txt file

Runs silently in the background

Lightweight and beginner-friendly



🛠️ Tech Stack
Python 3

pynput – for keyboard event handling



🚀 How to Run
Clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/Psalunkhe/simple-keylogger-prodigy.git
cd simple-keylogger-prodigy
Install dependencies:


pip install pynput
Run the script:


python keylogger.py
Find the log file (keylog.txt) in the same directory.
